            <h1 class="title"> The Life of Lal Bahadur Shastri</h1>
            <p class="txt">Lal Bahadur Shastri (2 October 1904 - 11 January 1966) was an Indian statesman who served as the second
                Prime Minister of India. He promoted the White Revolution - a national campaign to increase the
                production and supply of milk - by supporting the Amul milk co-operative of Anand, Gujarat and creating
                the National Dairy Development Board. Underlining the need to boost India's food production, Shastri
                also promoted the Green Revolution in India in 1965. This led to an increase in food grain production,
                especially in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.</p>

            <p class="txt">Shastri was born to Sharada Prasad Srivastava and Ramdulari Devi in Mughalsarai on 2 October 1904. He
                studied in East Central Railway Inter college and Harish Chandra High School, which he left to join the
                non-cooperation movement. He worked for the betterment of the Harijans at Muzaffarpur and dropped his
                caste-derived surname of "Srivastava". Shastri's thoughts were influenced by reading about Swami
                Vivekananda, Gandhi and Annie Besant. Deeply impressed and influenced by Gandhi, he joined the Indian
                independence movement in the 1920s. He served as the president of Servants of the People Society (Lok
                Sevak Mandal), founded by Lala Lajpat Rai and held prominent positions in Indian National Congress.
                Following independence in 1947, he joined the Indian government and became one of Prime Minister Nehru's
                key cabinet colleagues, first as Railways Minister (1951-56), and then in numerous other prominent
                positions, including the Home Minister.</p>
